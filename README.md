### 🔭 What I'm Working On

My current research projects involve:
- **AI-Powered Meeting Insights:** Investigating AI assistance to improve insights and outcomes in long-term collaborative online meetings.
- **Multi-modal LLMs for Collaboration:** Fusing multi-modal data streams (audio, video, text) to create more context-aware language models for meeting assistance.
- **Topic Drift & Meeting Analysis:** Designing models for topic drift detection in conversations, complemented by interactive data visualizations.
- **Interactive Image Data Exploration:** Exploring novel visual interfaces and designing techniques for interactively exploring large-scale image datasets.

### 🌱 My Core Interests & Skills

I am continuously deepening my expertise in:
- Data Visualizations and Vis Literacy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Advanced Transformer Architectures
- Multi-modal Machine Learning
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
